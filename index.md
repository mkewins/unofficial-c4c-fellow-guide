## Welcome, fellow fellow!

This is an _unofficial_ guide of resources for Code for Canada fellows.

Here are things I ([Maddy](https://twitter.com/madsewins)) asked past fellows about, or things that future fellows asked me about.

* How to find housing
* Where to live in Ottawa
* Gyms and fitness studios
* Local groups to connect with in Ottawa
* Ridesharing!
* Things to do in Ottawa
* Travel between Toronto–Ottawa
* Where to get good coffee

I'm hoping some of the resources below can help you, too!

This page is inspired by the [Unofficial Waterloo USA Intern Guide](https://stephenholiday.com/Unofficial-Waterloo-USA-Intern-Guide/).

## Ottawa

### Housing

#### How to find housing

If you're moving to Ottawa, check out the following resources for finding apartments:

* Ask past fellows, they may be able to hook you up with a landlord
* Ask your cohort, they might have friends with leads on apartments in Ottawa
* Kijiji
* Craigslist
* Facebook Marketplace
* Walk around Ottawa, look for "for rent" signs

#### Neighbourhood guide

[Where to live in Ottawa](https://moving2canada.com/where-to-live-in-ottawa/)

* **The Glebe** - On the expensive side, more single-family homes. Close to the Rideau Canal and Bank Street is the main drag.
* **Centretown** - There are tons of apartments in Centretown. As the name implies, it's pretty much the center of the city, so other neighbourhoods are accessible.
* **Sandy Hill** - Mixed neighbourhood, near UOttawa, so lots of students, but also embassys.
* **Downtown**
* **Golden Triangle**
* **Hintonburg**

### Gyms & fitness studios

Ottawa has a bunch of gyms and fitness studios, and intro month deals.

* [Barres and Wheels](https://barresandwheels.com/)
* [Elevate Yoga](http://elevateyoga.ca/) - $40 unlimited intro month
* [Pure Yoga](https://www.pureyogaottawa.com/) - $50 unlimited intro month
* [Goodlife](https://www.goodlifefitness.com/)
* [#bodiesbyphil](https://bodiesbyphil.com/) - $50 unlimited intro month

### Local groups

* ProductTank Ottawa (organized by Cohort 3 fellow, Andrea Hill!)

### Ridesharing

* Vrtucar

### Things to do

* Museums - free on Thursday evenings
* Gatineau Park
* Skate on the canal (winter)

### Travel between Toronto–Ottawa

* **VIA Rail** – You're trading off price and time, with reasonable comfort. If ****you book well in advance, you can get a roundtrip at the "Economy Escape" fare class for $80. Consider that the train is 5 hours, and it'll take you time to get to/from the train station on either end. The Ottawa train station is kind of in the middle of nowhere, but at least you can take the LRT directly there now.
* **Megabus**
* **Ridesharing** (e.g. Kangaride) – Super cheap, but takes time. Book a couple days in advance.
* **Porter** – Bussing to the Ottawa airport (YOW) during the day is doable. Uber/Lyft is obviously shorter and more direct.

### Good coffee

* Equator (in the National Arts Centre)
* Little Victories (Glebe)
* Happy Goat (various locations)
* Ministry of Coffee (various locations)
